                <p>Alpha Kappa Psi is recognized as the premier developer of principled business leaders. <!-- The Epsilon Sigma chapter at Georgia Tech does just that.  --></p><p>Our chapter continuously strives to develop our members and the Georgia Tech community to appreciate and demand higher ideals in business and professionalism. We supplement our members' college education with high-quality professional development and events.</p>
                <p>Our members receive resume critiquing services, interview skills development, public speaking opportunities, time management and communication skills that prepare them incredibly well to tackle the challenges of entering into, and prospering in, the business community. </p>

                <h1>Philanthropy</h1>
                <p>Alpha Kappa Psi realizes how important it is to give back to the community. Every semester, brothers collectively donate hundreds of hours to various causes around the Georgia Tech community and broader. Our brotherhood participates in Team Buzz, Tech Beautification Day, Relay for Life, MedShare, Sheltering Arms, and local park clean-up's, to name a few.</p>
                <!-- <p>Alumni have also come back and hosted Philanthropic Events like the Alzheimer's Walk, where we supported Alum brother Kylee Kuzminsky and her efforts to raise funds for research. In addition, Epsilon Sigma hosts a campus wide Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Day where students from various leadership organizations come together to mingle, make and distribute sandwiches to homeless shelters around Atlanta.</p> -->

Every member is encouraged to take on leadership roles within the chapter, the Georgia Tech community, and the greater global society. The guidance, support, and opportunities available to our members ensure that they are well equipped with the skills needed to effectively lead with enthusiasm and integrity.</p>
                <!-- <p>These crucial skills are developed through planning professional and social events, managing chapter budgets, scheduling chapter programs, holding directorship positions, and a great number of other outlets for leadership development. Such campus-wide events, like last year's collaborative events with Microsoft and Southern Company, would not have been possible without the leadership of our members. No matter what areas of leadership our members need to improve in, our chapter provides the forum to hone and develop the necessary skills.</p> -->

                            <p class="small">In the Fall, our main event is Blue Sapphire, which is a formal held in the Atlanta area. For the dinner and dance, Brothers get dressed up in formal wear and dance the night away. This night is special in several ways, including Brother, Pledge, and Alumni bonding, and superlative events. Through superlatives, we recognize brothers who go above and beyond the call of duty for the Fraternity, as well as fun recognitions such as best dressed Brother and most charming Brother.</p></div>

Brothers and Pledges spent their weekend relaxing on the beach followed up by a Hawaiian themed semi formal at night. Yellow Rose Semi-Formal is definitely a memorable trip that tends to be everyone's favorite every year. The best stories come out of Yellow Rose Semi-Formal and it's one event that you can't possibly miss!</p>
